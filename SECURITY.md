## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and recommended security best practices for users of the Docker Alpine project. Our commitment to security encompasses both the container images we provide and the guidance we offer to ensure secure deployments.

**Security is a shared responsibility.** While we work diligently to provide secure base images, proper configuration and deployment practices are essential for maintaining security in production environments.

---

## Security Features

Our Docker Alpine images are built with security as a foundational principle:

### **Alpine Linux Security Foundation**
- **Minimal attack surface** with reduced package footprint
- **musl libc** providing memory safety improvements over glibc
- **Position Independent Executables (PIE)** and stack-smashing protection
- **Regular security updates** from the Alpine Security Team

### **Container Hardening**
- **Non-root user execution** where applicable
- **Minimal package installation** with unnecessary components removed
- **Secure defaults** for all service configurations
- **Multi-stage builds** to eliminate build dependencies from final images

### **s6-overlay Integration**
- **Proper process supervision** preventing zombie processes
- **Graceful shutdown handling** for clean container termination
- **Service dependency management** ensuring secure startup order
- **Signal handling** for proper container lifecycle management

---

## Supported Versions

We maintain a focused support policy to ensure optimal security coverage:

| Version | Support Status | Security Updates | End of Life |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| `latest` (main branch) | ✅ **Fully Supported** | Regular updates | N/A |
| `3.19-*` | ✅ **Supported** | Security patches | TBD |
| `3.18-*` | ⚠️ **Limited Support** | Critical fixes only | 2024-12-31 |
| `< 3.18` | ❌ **Unsupported** | No updates | End of life |

> **Important:** Always use the latest supported version to ensure you have all security patches and updates. Unsupported versions may contain known vulnerabilities.

### Version Support Policy

- **Latest builds** receive immediate security updates
- **Current Alpine version** receives regular security patches
- **Previous Alpine version** receives critical security fixes for 6 months
- **Older versions** are immediately deprecated when new Alpine versions are released

---

## Vulnerability Reporting

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure from the security community.

### **Reporting Process**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT disclose publicly** (no GitHub issues, forums, social media, etc.)
2. **Send a detailed report** to: [maintainers@focela.com](mailto:maintainers@focela.com)
3. **Include the following information:**
   - **Vulnerability description** and classification (if known)
   - **Affected versions** and components
   - **Step-by-step reproduction** instructions
   - **Proof of concept** (if applicable)
   - **Potential impact** assessment
   - **Suggested mitigation** or fix (if available)
   - **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### **Response Timeline**

Our security team follows this process:

| Phase | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Acknowledgment** | Within 24 hours | Confirm receipt and assign tracking ID |
| **Initial Assessment** | Within 72 hours | Evaluate severity and impact |
| **Investigation** | 1-2 weeks | Thorough analysis and reproduction |
| **Resolution** | Varies by severity | Develop and test fix |
| **Disclosure** | After fix release | Coordinate responsible disclosure |

### **Recognition**

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our project:

- **Security advisories** will credit reporters (unless anonymity is requested)
- **Hall of fame** listing for significant contributions
- **Coordination** with CVE assignment when applicable

## Security Best Practices

### **Deployment Security**

#### **Image Management**
```bash
# Always pull the latest version
docker pull focela/alpine:latest

# Verify image integrity (when signatures are available)
docker trust inspect focela/alpine:latest

# Use specific tags for production consistency
docker pull focela/alpine:3.19-monitoring
```

#### **Container Configuration**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security recommendations
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: focela/alpine:latest
    # Run with restricted privileges
    user: "1000:1000"
    # Limit resources
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
          cpus: '0.5'
    # Mount volumes as read-only when possible
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    # Limit capabilities
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    # Use security options
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

### **Access Control**

#### **Privilege Management**
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Non-root execution**: Use dedicated service users when possible
- **Capability dropping**: Remove unnecessary Linux capabilities
- **Read-only filesystems**: Mount volumes as read-only where applicable

#### **Network Security**
- **Port exposure**: Only expose necessary ports
- **Network segmentation**: Use Docker networks for isolation
- **TLS encryption**: Enable encryption for all network communications
- **Firewall rules**: Implement proper ingress/egress controls

### **Configuration Security**

#### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Use secrets management for sensitive data
docker secret create db_password password.txt
docker service create --secret db_password myapp

# Avoid passing secrets via environment variables
# BAD: -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=secret123
# GOOD: Use Docker secrets or external secret management
```

#### **Volume Security**
```bash
# Mount volumes with appropriate permissions
docker run -v /host/data:/app/data:ro,Z focela/alpine:latest

# Use tmpfs for sensitive temporary data
docker run --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=100m focela/alpine:latest
```

### **Monitoring & Logging**

#### **Security Monitoring**
- **Container runtime security**: Monitor for suspicious activities
- **Log aggregation**: Centralize logs for security analysis
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Regularly scan images and containers
- **Compliance checking**: Automated security policy enforcement

#### **Recommended Tools**
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning for images and filesystems
- **Docker Bench**: Security configuration assessment
- **Falco**: Runtime security monitoring
- **OWASP ZAP**: Application security testing

## Incident Response

### **Security Incident Procedure**

If you suspect a security incident involving our images:

1. **Immediate containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Contact our security team at [maintainers@focela.com](mailto:maintainers@focela.com)
4. **Documentation**: Preserve evidence and maintain incident logs
5. **Recovery**: Follow established recovery procedures
6. **Post-incident**: Conduct thorough analysis and lessons learned

### **Incident Information**

When reporting incidents, please provide:

- **Timeline** of events and discovery
- **Affected systems** and scope of compromise
- **Indicators of compromise** (IOCs)
- **Initial impact assessment**
- **Immediate actions taken**

---
